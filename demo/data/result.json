By developing Fram, we can unlock the full potential of other fields too. Discovered in 1969, Fram was left undeveloped for more than 50 years because there seemed to be no cost-effective way to produce its resources. Until now. To keep costs down, Shell intends to turn a field reaching the last of its gas, Starling, into a staging post. An underwater pipeline laid in 2019 will start taking 41 million standard cubic feet of natural gas a day, plus condensates, fromFram toStarling. From Starling, it can flow through an existing pipeline to our Shearwater platform, before coming ashore at our StFergus gas plant.",

We also know the energy transition is unfolding, and we must bepart of it if we are to survive as a business.

Furthermore, macroeconomic risks can affect demand for our products. Government actions may also affect the prices of crude oil, natural gas, oil products and chemicals. This could happen, for example, by promoting the sale of lower-carbon electric vehicles or even through the future prohibition of sales of new diesel or gasoline vehicles, such as the prohibition in the United Kingdom (UK) beginning in 2035. Prices for oil and gas can also move independently of each other. Factors that influence supply and demand include operational issues, natural disasters, weather, pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, political instability, conflicts, economic conditions and actions by major oil and gas producing countries. In a low oiland gas price environment, we would generate less revenue from our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses, and, as a result, parts of those businesses could become less profitable, or could incur losses. Low oil and gas prices have also resulted and could continue to result in the debooking of proved oil or gas reserves, if they become uneconomic in this type ofprice environment. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices, or rising costs, have resulted and could continue to result in projects being delayed or cancelled. Assets have also been impaired in the past, and there could be impairments in the future. Low oil and gas prices could also affect our ability to maintain our long-term capital investment programme and dividend payments. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect the financial, fiscal, legal, political and social stability of countries that rely significantly on oil and gas revenue. In a high oil and gas price environment, we could experience sharp increases in costs, and, under some production-sharing contracts, our entitlement to proved reserves wouldbe reduced. Higher prices could also reduce demand for our products, which could result in lower profitability, particularly in our Downstream business. Also, higher prices can result in more capacity beingbuilt whichresults in an oversupply of products that can negatively impact our LNG and Chemicals business. Accordingly, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flowsandfinancial condition.",

For example, theEU and the USA continue to impose restrictions and prohibitions on certain transactions involving countries such as Syria, Venezuela, Russia and Cuba. In addition, the USA continues to have comprehensive sanctions in place against Iran, while the EU and other nations continue to maintain targeted sanctions. Additional restrictions and controls directed at defined oil and gas activities in Russia, which were imposed by the EU and the USA in 2014, remain in force. Further restrictions regarding Russia were introduced by the USA in 2017 and expanded in 2018. Both the EU and the USA introduced sectoral sanctions against Venezuela in 2017, which the USA expanded in 2018 and 2019. The US sanctions primarily target the government of Venezuela and the oil industry. Many other nations are also adopting trade-control programmes similar to those administered by the EU and the USA.

According to the IEA, near-term global oil demand growth is projected at around 1.3 million b/d per annum. To keep supply and demand in balance, demand growth and natural production decline from existing operations are to be met by supply growth. If OPEC members and co-operating non-OPEC resource holders continue implementing their current production agreement successfully, then supply growth would have to be delivered by non-OPEC countries, most notably the USA. Markets could tighten and prices could rise if US supply growth slows. The fall in US drilling activity in 2019 could be a first indicator of moderating US supply growth. A lack of industry-wide investment in new supply projects could lead to further market tightening in the next few years, given the long lead time of many of these projects.",

There was some downward pressure on prices due to strong gas supply growth of about 8 billion cubic feet per day (cf/d), which averaged 10% higher than 2018. Gas supply growth was, in part, driven by a growth of associated gas from oil fields, helped by oil prices above $50/b, and by new gas pipeline capacity.

PowerNap (Shell interest 100%), discovered in 2014, is a subsea tie-back to the Shell-operated Olympus production hub. The project is expected to start production in late 2021 and expected to produce up to35 thousand boe/d at peak rates. In August 2019, the Whale project moved into the Define phase. The project is 60% Shell and 40% Chevron, with the exception of the AC815 lease area which is 40% Shell and 60%Chevron. ",

In the US West Coast gross margins improved, partly due to product prices being supported by unplanned outages in the region. Globally, year-on-year growth in demand for oil products has slowed in line with slowing global economic growth. Refinery capacity additions, especially in the Middle East and Asia, combined with lower demand growth have led to generally lower refinery utilisations, which weakened margins. Refinery activity continued to be low in Latin America amid the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and poor investment climate. On January 1, 2020, the new International Maritime Organization low- sulphur shipping fuel specification came into effect. The industry has started preparations but the full effect of the implementation is expected later in the year.",

Changes in benchmark prices of crude oil and natural gas in any particular period therefore provide only a broad indicator of changes in our Integrated Gas and Upstream earnings in that period. In the longer term, replacement of proved oil and gas reserves will affect our ability tomaintain or increase production levels, which in turn will affect our earnings and cash flows. Changes in any one of a range of factors, derived from either within the industry or the broader economic environment, can influence refining and marketing margins. The precise impact of any such changes depends on how the oil markets respond to them. The market response is affected by factors such as: whether the change affects all crude oil types or only a specific grade; regional andglobal crude oil and refined products inventories; and the collective speed of response of refiners and product marketers in adjusting their operations. As a result, margins fluctuate from region to region and fromperiod to period.",

This helps us to understand and manage the effects our projects could have on the surrounding environment and local communities. We have standards and a clear governance structure in place to help manage potential impacts. We are committed to the safety of our people and contractors. The standards for Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Social Performance (HSSE & SP) and the scope for application of each of these standards is specified in the Shell HSSE & SP Control Framework (CF). TheCF is made up of a series of mandatory manuals, which are in line with the Shell Commitment and Policy on HSSE & SP and the Shell Code of Conduct. They are supported by a number of guidance documents and complemented by assurance protocols. The CF applies to every Shell entity, including all employees and contract staff, and to Shell-operated ventures. The CF defines standards and accountabilities at each level of the organisation and sets out the procedures and processes people are required to follow. We require that all significant HSSE & SP risks associated with our business activities are assessed and managed to as low as reasonably practicable.

We strive to reduce risks and to minimise the potential impact of any incident. Our standards also apply to any joint ventures we operate. Wefocus on the three areas of safety with the highest risks associated with our activities: personal, process, and transport. We ensure that people responsible for tasks involving a significant safety hazard have the necessary training, skills and competencies. We employ a large number of contractors and we work with them to ensure they understand our safety requirements. Together we build skills and expertise to improve safety performance. We expect everyone working for us to comply with our 12 mandatory Life-Saving Rules. If employees break these rules, they face disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

It starts at the design and construction stage of our projects and is implemented throughout the life cycle of these facilities to ensure they are safely operated, well-maintained and regularly inspected. Our global standards and operating procedures define the controls and physical barriers we require to prevent incidents. For example, our offshore wells are designed with at least two independent barriers in the direction of flow to mitigate the risk of an uncontrolled release of hydrocarbons. We regularly inspect, test and maintain these barriers to ensure they meet our standards. In the event of a loss of containment such as a spill or a leak, we employ independent recovery measures to prevent the release from becoming catastrophic. This system of barriers and recovery measures is known as a \u201cbow-tie\u201d, a model that visually represents a system where personal and process safety hazards are managed through prevention and response barriers. Since 2016, we have been working on strengthening barriers that involve critical safety tasks carried out by frontline staff.

In 2019, SPDC managed to reduce the volume of operational spills of more than 100 kilograms to about 0.03 thousand tonnes of crude oil (seven incidents) compared to about 0.4 thousand tonnes of crude oil (15 incidents) in 2018. This represents a reduction of about 93% in operational spills weight year-on-year.",

The clean-up consists of three phases: 1) removal of free-phase surface oil, 2) remediation of soil, and 3) planting of mangroves and monitoring. The first phase was completed in August 2018 and the contract procurement process for phase two was finalised in 2019 with four remediation contractors having international technical partners and two consultancy contractors selected.

Due diligence in each focus area is typically exercised in areas where there may be a risk of impact to people, and is supported by experts internally. We recognise the role of due diligence in bringing our commitments to life. For example, in our supply chains, we engage contractors and suppliers deemed to be at higher risk for labour rights issues to undertake assessments of their management system prior to the award of a contract. Results of these supplier assessments are evaluated, and where gaps are found, we may work withsuppliers and contractors to help them implement corrective action. We may also carry out on-site audits or consider terminating contracts ifserious or persistent shortcomings are found. The most common shortcomings found during our supplier assessments typically relate to policy rather than performance gaps in the following areas: freely chosen employment; child labour avoidance; working hours, wages and benefits; dormitory, housing and working conditions; humane treatment, equal opportunities and freedom of association; and supply chain and performance management. In conjunction with the Shell Supplier Principles, Shell companies use a joint industry supplier capability assessment delivered in collaboration with other operators.

In 2017, we joined the Oil and Gas Preparer Forum, initiated by the TCFD and convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The forum\u2019s objectives are to review the current state of climate-related financial disclosures, to identify examples of effective disclosure practices and make proposals on how disclosures may evolve over time. These examples were summarised and published ina report, including reflections from investors, in 2018. The Shell Energy Transition Report (SET report), also published in 2018, described the energy transition and considered Shell\u2019s resilience against future scenarios. The 2018 SET report followed our discussions with the TCFD about increasing transparency to help investors understand climate- related risks and opportunities. Our approach to the energy transition asdescribed in the 2018 SET report, in combination with the Shell Sustainability Report (expected to be published in April 2020) and theIndustry Associations Climate Review, aims to provide additional information to this Report in responding to TCFD recommendations, including discussing the energy transition and Shell\u2019s portfolio resilience.

By 2050, our carbon cost estimates for all countries increase to $85/tonne ofGHG emissions. These estimates were developed using the current Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by countries aspart of the Paris Agreement. They are the first NDCs under the Paris Agreement and are scheduled to be revised every five years. Therefore, ascountries update their NDCs, we expect to update our estimates too. Accordingly, we believe they are a more accurate reflection of society\u2019s current implementation of the Paris Agreement. The UN believes the current NDCs are consistent with limiting the average global temperature rise to around three degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

For many countries, using gas instead of coal in power generation can make a large contribution, at lower cost, to meeting GHG emission reduction objectives. We expect that, in combination with renewables and the use of CCS, natural gas will be essential in significantly lowering GHG emissions. Natural gas made up more than half of Shell\u2019s proved reserves at the end of 2019. As a leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG), and with our conventional gas assets and technologies for recovering gas from tight-rock formations, we can supply natural gas to replace coal for power generation. Natural gas can also act as a partner for intermittent renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to maintain a steady supply of electricity, because gas-fired plants can start and stop relatively quickly.

        "paragraph": "The IEA estimates that natural gas operations have an average methane leakage rate of 1.7%. At this rate, natural gas emits between 45% and 55% less GHG emissions than coal when burnt at a power plant. Higher levels of methane emissions, however, would reduce this benefit, and we recognise the importance of assessing, and where possible, reducing methane emissions. Methane from the flaring and venting of gas (including equipment venting) in our upstream oil and gas operations was the largest contributor to our reported methane emissions in 2019. We are working to reduce methane emissions from these sources by reducing the overall level of flaring and venting. We also continue to implement leak detection and repair programmes across our sites to identify unintended losses and high-emission equipment, such as high-bleed pneumatic devices, so they can be replaced or repaired. We continue to work on confirming that we have identified all potential methane sources and that we have reported our emissions from these sources in line with regulations and industry standards. In 2017, we joined the Climate and Clean Air Coalition Oil & Gas Methane Partnership. It brings together industry, governments and non-governmental organisations to improve quantification of methane emissions globally and work towards reducing them. Also in 2017, Shell led the development of a set of non-binding Methane Guiding Principles for reducing methane emissions across the natural gas value chain. The principles focus on: continually reducing methane emissions; advancing strong performance across gas value chains; improving accuracy of methane emissions data; advocating sound policies and regulations on methane emissions; and increasing transparency. Shell has been involved in the development of all actions associated with the guiding principles, including the development of a major global outreach programme. Theobjective is to address a gap in knowledge on managing methane emissions, and thereby provide high-quality educational material and courses on methane science, methane reduction strategies and planning, measurement techniques, technology, policy, and where to get guidance and support. The publicly accessible programme consists of two courses: an executive course targeting senior managers and executives, and masterclasses for managers of frontline staff.",

Asdiscussed above, and as a better way to inform and drive our investment choices and adapt our business over time, in 2017, we announced our Net Carbon Footprint ambition. Our approach to calculating the Net Carbon Footprint covers emissions directly from Shell operations (including from the extraction, transportation and processing of raw materials, and transportation of products), those generated by third parties who supply energy to us for production, and our customers\u2019 emissions from their use of our energy products. Also included are emissions from elements of this life cycle not owned by Shell, such as oil and gas processed by Shell but not produced by Shell, or from oil products and electricity marketed by Shell that have not been processed or generated at a Shell facility. The calculation also includes biofuels, as well as emissions that we offset by using CCS or natural carbon sinks, such as forests and wetlands. Chemicals and lubricants products, which are not used to produce energy, are excluded from thescope of this ambition.",

Using nature to capture carbon from the atmosphere presents an immediate opportunity. It can help to bridge the gap until other low-carbon solutions are deployed at scale, or to compensate for emissions which cannot be avoided. Nature-based solutions are expected to be one of Shell\u2019s tools to reduce our Net Carbon Footprint. Nature- based projects typically involve the protection or redevelopment of natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands, allowing those ecosystems to capture and store more carbon on our behalf. These projects, which also support local communities and conserve biodiversity, generate carbon-emission rights that can then be bought by energy consumers around the world. In 2019, we launched a programme to invest in natural ecosystems as part of our strategy to act on global climate change. For example, in the UK, we are working with Forestry and Land Scotland, a government agency, to generate carbon credits by helping toplant or regenerate around 1 million trees over the next five years.

The Nomination and Succession Committee noted the disciplined approach to succession planning and execution, the holistic view taken of leadership and the high levels of information and transparency underpinning it. It particularly noted improved focus on performance and on the talent pipeline of high potential individuals beyond just senior management levels. Along with the results of the annual Shell People Survey, it provided a deeper understanding of culture, leadership talent and the strong levels of employee engagement across thebusiness.

For Non-executive Director succession, the Committee adopted in January 2019 a set of revised Principles for the Strategic Composition of the Board. The principles include both quantitative and qualitative principles, considering both: (i) the overall Board composition and diversity of gender, nationality, background experience and skillsets desired that align with the Company\u2019s strategy and purpose; and (ii) the values, attitudes, and behaviours expected. For Senior Management succession, the principles include process-specific principles, including the identification and development of succession candidates and the long-term nature of the succession planning process. Each Committee meeting includes both sets of principles and, utilising those, the Committee executes changes through a well-defined and diligent process with overall Board engagement. The Committee agrees candidate profiles and meets prospective candidates well ahead of any selection decision being necessary. It also engages the Board early in the process to ensure all Directors have an opportunity to meet and assess prospective candidates. Consequently, some of the leaders whom the Committee and Board have engaged with extensively in the past are now members of the Board or the Executive Committee.",

The AC visited Shell\u2019s advanced security operations in the Netherlands, the finance operations centre in Chennai and the IT Hub in Bangalore.

To arrive at this conclusion, the AC critically assessed drafts of the 2019 Annual Report including the financial statements and discussed with management the process undertaken to ensure that these requirements were met. This process included: verifying that the contents of the 2019 Annual Report are consistent with the information shared with the Board and management during the year to support their assessment of Shell\u2019s position and performance; ensuring that consistent materiality thresholds are applied for favourable and unfavourable items; considering comments from the external auditor; and receiving assurance from the Executive Committee (EC). The AC further reviewed and considered the Directors\u2019 half-year and full-year statements with respect to the going concern basis of accounting. As noted in the viability statement, the Board also reviews the strategic plan which takes account of longer-term forecasts and a wide range of outlooks. Factors considered included: the impact of commodity prices; exchange rates; future carbon costs; major agreements such as LNG contract renewals; planned growth programmes; the financial framework; Shell\u2019s business portfolio developments; the project funnel to support future growth; and running models of the financial impact of certain of Shell\u2019s principal risks materialising using severe but possible scenarios. The AC considered the mitigating measures and sensitivities that management had applied to themodelling of such scenarios when evaluating the viability statement. TheAC also considered external commentaries suggesting that viability statements should be extended beyond a period of three years and concluded that the three-year period selected by the Board for the review of Shell\u2019s prospects, in line with the operating plan, remained appropriate. The AC supported the inclusion of Shell\u2019s viability statement in \u201cGovernance\u201d on page 165 and considered such statement in line withbest practice guidance issued by the FRC.",

In particular, the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make assumptions regarding future profitability and is therefore inherently uncertain. With effect from January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 Leases replaced IAS 17 Leases. Under the new standard, all lease contracts, with limited exceptions, are recognised in the financial statements by way of right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Shell applied the modified retrospective transition approach without restating comparative information. In March 2019, the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRIC) decision on recognition of lease liabilities in unincorporated joint operations was concluded. During Q2 and Q3 2019 potential exposures were assessed to determine where Shell, as operator, has primary responsibility for the lease liability and would therefore be required to recognise these leases. A review was carried out to consider the discount rate applied for provisions due to a lower rate for 30-year US Treasury bonds. Based on management\u2019s review the discount rate for provisions was lowered from 4% to 3% in 2019. This was applied to provision balances at December 31, 2019.",

Particular attention was given to the assessments of any impairment indicators, as well as the accounting for any retained obligations, together with the assumptions used in determining any resulting charges and the tax treatment thereof. The AC challenged whether there were indicators of impairment or reversals of previously recorded impairments and carefully considered the impairment assessments that were performed. In so doing, the AC reviewed the oil and gas price and refining margin outlooks against market developments and benchmarks. The potential impact of certain price sensitivities was also considered, together with the relevant discount rates applied. The AC also reviewed other significant inputs to impairment assessments, including proved oil and gas reserves. The AC also considered the potential impact of climate change and energy transition. The AC considered tax exposures, including those associatedwith 2019 disposals. The AC also evaluated the appropriateness of the recognition of deferred tax assets. TheAC deemed the resulting assessments of uncertain tax exposures and the recognition of deferred tax assets to bereasonable. In 2018, the AC appraised and approved accounting policychanges resulting from the implementation of IFRS 16.

This increase is primarily due to the effect of including employees from Shell\u2019s acquisition of First Utility in the calculation for thefirst time. On a like-for-like basis, it would have been 15.1%, an improvement of 3.5 percentage points. Shell\u2019s goal is to ensure the equal participation of women and men in all areas of work, at all levels and locations ensuring equal access to the same recognition, reward and career progression opportunities. As 2019 illustrates, these changes will be influenced by changes in our business and may be non-linear. However, theREMCO hasconfidence in the policies Shell has to increase the representation ofwomen at all levels in the organisation. ",

In 2019, we reviewed a range of alternative reward structures that might moderate high pay outcomes while keeping target pay competitive. Following extensive consultation with shareholders, we concluded that changing reward design is not the best way to address quantum if it means making compromises on the alignment between pay and performance in the delivery of strategy. Thisalso allows foralignment between reward structures for Executive Directors and employees. The REMCO also considered whether a cap onremuneration levels was appropriate. The REMCO believes it is important to maintain flexibility in order to respond to changing businessrequirements and/or governance developments if required. Theintroduction of an arbitrarily defined cap may adversely affect that flexibility and, given the good alignment between pay and performance, would be an unnecessary policy feature. Also some shareholders are of the view that strong performance should be rewarded with strong variable pay outcomes. Accordingly, we have sought ways to manage quantum outcomes withinthe existing tried and tested performance framework. ",

This provides alignment throughout the organisation to Shell\u2019s culture and strategy. The annual operating plan translates into targets on the annual bonus scorecard and aquarterly update on performance against scorecard targets is provided toemployees. Similarly the LTIP is largely based on outperforming the competition, and regular updates on Shell\u2019s performance against competitors is provided to employees. In reviewing the Directors\u2019 Remuneration Policy, theREMCO sought to make changes that help to simplify remuneration structures (for example, removing the individual performance factor for Executive Directors) and giving more transparent outcomes (for example, removing the bonus asymmetry from the CEO\u2019s remuneration structure). Toassist in the mitigation of reputational risk and ensure proportionality, thepowers of the REMCO to apply malus and clawback and make discretionary adjustments to variable pay outcomes have been expanded, with the intention that the REMCO will use discretionto ensure the highest pay outcomes are delivered only foroutstanding performance.",

Cash performance was also strong with CFFO leading the comparator group on absolute CFFO generated, andFCF was wellabove the cumulative target set for the three-year performance cycle. ROACE has also improved, reflecting the focus on capital discipline. The REMCO also took account of the fact that Shell\u2019s competitors are some of the strongest companies in the industry and achieving relative outperformance is challenging.",

As for all other pre-2013 members of the Shell Pension Plan, she has an annual choice of two accrual formulas with different forms of benefits, one in the form of a lifetime annuity and the other allowing for a lump-sum payment. She elected to accrue benefits for 2019 under the former. Approximately 10,000 out of 17,000 Shell US employees have the option of choosing between the two formulas. These arrangements are the same for all employees who joined Shell US at the same time as Jessica Uhl. The difference in pension provision for Jessica Uhl, compared to employees who joined pre-2013, is that her bonus is not pensionable as an Executive Director while for other relevant US employees the bonus is pensionable. She also has a deferred Dutch defined benefit pension plan, as a result ofa prior Shell assignment onlocal Dutch terms and conditions.",

As a result, FCF targets are set annually for each annual operating plan and will only be disclosed in aggregate retrospectively after the three-year period.

While the Articles do not require Directors to hold shares in the Company, the Remuneration Committee believes that Executive Directors should align their interests with those of shareholders by holding shares in the Company. The CEO is expected to build up a shareholding of seven times his base salary over five years from appointment and from 2020, the CFO is expected to build up a shareholding of five times their base salary over the same period. In the event that another Executive Director joins the Board, the Remuneration Committee will determine their shareholding requirement, which will not be less than 200% of their base salary. Executive Directors will be required to maintain their requirement (or existing shareholding if less than the guideline) for a period of two years post-employment. Non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their fixed annual fee and maintain that holding during their tenure. All Directors hold shares and such interests can be found in the \u201cDirectors\u2019 Remuneration Report\u201d onpages135-138.",

Building on this knowledge, we updated our understanding of Shell\u2019s strategy and business model.

Climate change and the energy transition are becoming increasingly important for the sector. As part of our audit, we assessed whether Shell\u2019s energy transition assumptions used in setting oil and gas commodity price assumptions and refining margin assumptions were reasonable in the light of the commitments that Shell have made with respect to decarbonisation in accordance with the Paris Agreement.

At theadoption date, additional lease liabilities were recognised for leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17 (see Note 3). These lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using entity-specific incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019. In general, a corresponding right-of-use asset was recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted bythe amount of any prepaid or accrued lease paymentrelating to thespecific lease contract, as recognised on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018.

The IFRS 17 model combines a current balance sheet measurement of insurance contracts with recognition of profit over the period that services are provided. Thegeneral model in the standard requires insurance contract liabilities tobe measured using probability- weighted current estimates of future cash flows, an adjustment for risk, and a contractual service margin representing the profit expected from fulfilling the contracts.

All operating lease contracts, with limited exceptions, were recognised on the balance sheet by recognising right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities at the transition date. Shell applied the modified retrospective transition method, and consequently comparative information is not restated. As a practical expedient, no reassessment was performed of contracts that were previously identified as leases and contracts that were not previously identified as containing a lease applying IAS 17 Leases (\u201cIAS 17\u201d) and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. At the adoption date, additional lease liabilities were recognised for leases previously classified as operating leases applying IAS 17. These lease liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments and discounted using entity-specific incremental borrowing rates at January 1, 2019. In general, a corresponding right-of-use asset was recognised for an amount equal to each lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to the specific lease contract, as recognised on the balance sheet at December 31, 2018. Provisions for onerous lease contracts at December 31, 2018 were adjusted to the respective right-of-use assets recognised at January 1, 2019. As a practical expedient the recognition exemption for leases with a remaining term of less than 12 months from the adoption date was applied upon adoption.",

The EMTN programme is updated each year, most recently in July 2019. In 2019, debt issued under this programme amounted to$3 billion (2018: $nil). The US shelf registration provides Shell with the flexibility to issue debt securities, ordinary shares, preferred shares and warrants. The registration is updated every three years and was last updated in December 2017. During 2019, debt totalling $4 billion (2018: $3 billion) was issued under the registration. On December 13, 2019, Shell entered into $10 billion revolving credit facilities, which in anticipation of the LIBOR reform (see Note 2B), were linked to the new Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). Under the terms of the facilities, the LIBOR interest rate will be replaced by SOFR as early as the first anniversary of the signing date of these revolving credit facilities. The committed credit facilities are available at pre-agreed margins, with $2 billion expiring in 2020 and $8 billion expiring in 2024. Each facility includes two one-year extension options at the discretion of each lender.The terms and availability are not conditional on Shell\u2019s financial ratios nor its financial credit ratings. The interest and feespaidon both facilities are linked to Shell\u2019s progress towards reaching its short-term Net Carbon Footprint intensity target. ",

The maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for an ordinary share is the higher of: (i) an amount equal to 5% above the average market value for an ordinary share for the five business days immediately preceding the date of the purchase; and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is carried out.

There are approximately 36 such cases currently pending. These suits assert various theories of strict liability and negligence, and seek to recover actual damages, including drinking well treatment and remediation costs. Most assert claims for punitive damages. While the Company continues to vigorously defend these lawsuits, a new environmental regulatory standard became effective in the State of California, where a majority of the suits are pending. The new standard requires public water systems state wide to perform quarterly or monthly sampling of their drinking water sources for a chemical contained in certain pesticides, beginning in January 2018. Water systems deemed out of compliance with the new five parts per trillion regulatory standard must take corrective action to resolve the exceedance or take the potable water source out of service. In response to this new regulatory standard, the Company is monitoring the sampling results to determine the number of wells potentially impacted. Based on the claims asserted and SOC\u2019s track record, with regard to amounts paid to resolve varying claims, management does not expect the outcome of these lawsuits pending at December 31, 2019, to have a material adverse impact on Shell. However, there remains a high degree of uncertainty regarding the potential outcome of some of these pending lawsuits, as well as their potential effect on future operations, earnings, cash flows and Shell\u2019s financial condition.

Proved reserves can be either developed or undeveloped. The definitions used are in accordance with the SEC Rule 4\u201310 (a) of Regulation S-X. We include proved reserves associated with future production that will be consumed in operations. Proved reserves shown are net of any quantities of crude oil or natural gas that are expected to be (or could be) taken as royalties in kind. Proved reserves outside North America include quantities that will be settled as royalties in cash. Proved reserves include certain quantities of crude oil or natural gas that will be produced under arrangements that involve Shell subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates in risks and rewards but do not transfer title of the product to those entities. Subsidiaries\u2019 proved reserves at December 31, 2019, were divided into 79% developed and 21% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. For the Shell share of joint ventures and associates, the proved reserves at December 31, 2019, were divided into 86% developed and 14% undeveloped on a barrel of oil equivalent basis. Proved reserves are recognised under various forms of contractual agreements. Shell\u2019s proved reserves volumes at December 31, 2019, present in agreements such as production-sharing contracts (\u201cPSC\u201d), tax/variable royalty contracts or other forms of economic entitlement contracts, where the Shell share of reserves can vary with commodity prices, were 2,170 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids, and 13,433 thousand million standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas. Proved reserves cannot be measured exactly because estimation ofreserves involves subjective judgement (see \u201cRisk factors\u201d on page27 and our \u201cProved reserves assurance process\u201d below). Theseestimates remain subject to revision and are unaudited supplementary information. PROVED RESERVES ASSURANCE PROCESS A central group of reserves experts, who on average have around 28 years\u2019 experience in the oil and gas industry, undertake the primary assurance of the proved reserves bookings. This group of experts is part of the Resources Assurance and Reporting (\u201cRAR\u201d) organisation within Shell. A Vice President with 34 years\u2019 experience in the oil and gas industry currently heads the RAR organisation. He is a member of theSociety of Petroleum Engineers, Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and holds a BA in mathematics from Oxford University and an MEng in Petroleum Engineering from Heriot Watt University. The RAR organisation reportsdirectly to an Executive Vice President of Finance, who is a member of the Upstream Reserves Committee (\u201cURC\u201d). The URC is a multidisciplinary committee consisting of senior representatives from the Finance, Legal, Projects & Technology and Upstream organisations. The URC reviews and endorses all major (larger than 20 million barrels of oil equivalent) proved reserves bookings and de-bookings and endorses the total aggregated proved reserves. Final approval of all proved reserves bookings remains with Shell\u2019s Executive Committee, and all proved reserves bookings are reviewed by Shell\u2019s Audit Committee. TheInternal Audit function also provides secondary assurance throughaudits of the control framework.",

Significant changes in these proved reserves are discussed below. Volumes are not adjusted to standard heat content. Apart from integrated projects, volumes of gas are reported on an \u201cas-sold\u201d basis. The price used to calculate future revenue and cash flows from proved gas reserves is the contract price or the 12-month average on \u201cas-sold\u201d volumes. Volumes associated with integrated projects are those measured at a designated transfer point between the upstream and downstream portions of the integrated project. Natural gas volumes are converted into oil equivalent using a factor of 5,800 scf per barrel. PROVED RESERVES 2019\u20132018 Shell subsidiaries Asia The net increase of 859 thousand million scf in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Qatar and Malaysia (Sabah and Sarawak). Oceania The net increase of 699 thousand million scf in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Surat, Gorgon and Jansz-lo. Africa The net increase of 290 thousand million scf in revisions and reclassifications was mainly in Bonny and Gbaran (Nigeria). Canada The net increase of 317 thousand million scf in extensions and discoveries was mainly in Groundbirch.

In our view, the information so calculated does not provide a reliable measure of future cash flows from proved reserves, nor does it permit a realistic comparison to be made of one entity with another because the assumptions used cannot reflect the varying circumstances within each entity. In addition, a substantial but unknown proportion of future real cash flows from oil and gas production activities is expected to derive from reserves which have already been discovered, but which cannot yet be regarded as proved.

These assumptions and the judgements of management that are based on them are subject to change as new information becomes available. Cash flow estimates are risk-adjusted to reflect local conditions as appropriate and discounted at a rate based on Shell\u2019s marginal cost of debt.
