In 2019, we continued to offer lower-emission energy products, including natural gas, biofuels, hydrogen and renewable power. We increased our investment in natural ecosystems that produce carbon credits to help drivers in two key markets, the Netherlands and the UK, to offset their carbon emissions.

Our employees must show absolute integrity every day. They must meet the ethical standards that Shell, and society, expects. Our standards are set out in Shellâ€™s business principles and code of conduct. We are very clear that it is not sufficient for Shellâ€™s actions and behaviour merely to be legally sound. We must take a broad view that also considers the wider implications of our commercial choices and our stakeholdersâ€™ view of them. We spent a lot of time in 2019 reinforcing the standard of behaviour we expect. For example, all senior executives completed a mandatory ethical leadership programme.
